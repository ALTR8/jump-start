# Lesson Plan

### Scope
* Functions and blocks each introduce new scopes
* A scope is basically an environment where variables are accessible (think inside a function vs outside of it)
* A **local variable** is only defined within its scope
* You should generally not name a local variable the same as the function or as another variable in scope, because it causes a namespace conflict. (I.e., the older variable will no longer be accessible.)

Exercise:

* Will this function work? Don't run it, just analyze the code mentally.

```ruby
i = 0
def iterate!
  while i < 5
    puts i
    i += 1
  end
end

iterate!
```

* What about this one?

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum = 0
arr.each do |el|
  sum += el
end
puts sum
```

* And this one?

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
def array_product(arr)
  arr.each do |el|
    el *= el
  end
  puts el
end

array_product(arr)
```

### Pass-by-reference
* When you pass a variable into a function or a method, the original variable always continues to refer to the same object.
* A variable is just a **pointer**. Think of it as just writing down the address of a building into an address book.
* Re-assigning the same variable within another scope doesn't mutate the original object, it just changes that scope's address book.
* Writing stuff into your address book doesn't actually change where buildings live! It's just your own form of book-keeping.
* More concretely, all Ruby objects live in memory. And they'll still live in memory unless you explicitly mutate them.

### Mutation

* Safe vs. unsafe methods. The bang, `!`, at the end of the method name denotes an unsafe method.
* The bang generally means the method mutates the input.
* Pay attention to whether you need to re-assign your variable, or mutate it in your function.
* Some Ruby objects are **immutable**, which means they cannot mutate. You must create a new and different object and re-assign your variable if you want to change an immutable object.
* Things that are immutable:
  * Booleans (`true`/`false`)
  * `nil`
  * Numbers
* Arrays and hashes are **mutable**. `[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]` is an array with some immutable elements, and one mutable element. This could make a difference if you are iterating over elements of an array and changing them as you go.
* Here's a rule of thumb for mutabilityâ€”if you can pass it into a function and change the object, then it's mutable. Otherwise it's not.
* Think about it: can you imagine something immutable, like `true` or `0` changing because you called some function?

    ```ruby
  var = false
  crazy_function_that_does_crazy_things!(var)
  puts var == false # no function can change its value!
    ```

Exercises:
* What will this code do?

```ruby
arr = [1,2,3,4]

def destroy_array!(arr)
  arr = []
end

puts destroy_array!(arr)
puts arr
```

* And this code?

```ruby
arr = [1,2,3,4]

def double_arr(original_arr)
  doubled_arr = original_arr
  (0...original_arr.length).each do |i|
    doubled_arr << original_arr[i]
  end
  doubled_arr
end

puts double_arr(arr)
puts arr
```

* What about this?

```ruby
def add_all_up_to_n(n)
  (0..n).each do |val|
    n += val
  end
  n
end

n = 5
puts add_all_up_to_n(n)
puts n

```

### Nested iteration
* Looping within a loop. First element touches every element, second element touches every element, etc.
* Think like the hands of a clock!
* Beware of edge conditions. Should your two iterators ever be equal? Should they ever be 0? Should they reach the end of the array?
* Bubble sort!
* Generate all pairs

Exercises:

* Implement `bubble_sort!` on your own now!
* Write a function called `all_word_pairs(str)` that given a string, returns an array of every possible pair of words.


## Enumerables++

There are lots of crazy and powerful things you can do with advanced enumerable methods. Check out the Ruby documentation on `Enumerable` if you are curious, but here are a few of the more common methods:

* in-line blocks: `do` => `{`, `end` => `}`
* `#select` and `#reject`
* `#count`
* `#reduce`
* `#max_by`
* One-line `is_prime?`


Exercises:

* Use enumerable methods to add up all the numbers that are not equal to 2 in an array. Do NOT modify the original array.
* Use the `#max_by` method to find the longest string in an array of strings.
* Write an `is_prime?` function in one line using enumerable methods.
* Write a one line function that lists all primes less than or equal to the argument passed in. Use enumerable methods in combination with your `is_prime?` function.


## More array methods

* `reverse`
* `min` and `max`
* `sort`
* `uniq` removes all duplicate elements.
* `rotate`
* `shuffle` puts the elements in a random order.

Exercises:

* Write your own `uniq` method, called `my_uniq`.

## More string methods

* Several `String` methods exist for formatting purposes.
* `#chomp` or `#strip` removes a newline from the end.
* You can multiply strings. `"Ha" * 3` outputs ``"HaHaHa"``
* `reverse` will return a string with all the characters in the opposite order.
* `gsub` provides search and replace functionality for strings.
* `empty?` is a Ruby-like way of checking to see if the string equals the empty string: `str == ""`.

Exercises:

* Re-write the triangle exercises above in terms of the `*` operator.
* Write a function that translates the Hobbit into the Lord of the Rings. It should replace all occurrences of the string "Bilbo" with the string "Frodo".
* Write an `is_palindrome?` function that checks to see if the string reads the same backwards as it does forwards. It should not count spaces or be case sensitive.
* Given a string, find the longest substring which is a palindrome. Do not count single letters or the empty string as a palindrome.


## Parallel assignment

* Assign multiple variables at the same time with `dog1, dog2 = "Rover", "Spot"`.
* This works even if the values on the right side are in an array, and even if there are more values in that array than we need.

```
names = ["Rover", "Spot", "Clifford"]
dog1, dog2, dog3 = names
# dog1 == "Rover"
# dog2 == "Spot"
# dog3 == "Clifford"

song = "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"
song = song.downcase.split(", ")
# song == ["harder", "better", "faster", "stronger"]
daft, punk = song
# daft == "harder"
# punk == "better"
```

* You can swap two variables with parallel assignment. For example, swap the position of two array elements with

```
arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
```

* In other, less convenient programming languages, you need a temporary variable to do this swapping.

Exercise:
  * Go back over your old code and see where you can refactor to use parallel assignment. `bubble_sort!` is a good place to start.
