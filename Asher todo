Meta:
  - Write one example and delegate to HIR/Scott?
  - Delegate setting up and coordinating slack to HIR/Scott with Daniel? (Optional)
    - Reading on terminal (`pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `ruby ____.rb`, googling to look up how to do things (e.g., "how do I display a file in terminal" for `cat`)).  Use the teaching techniques (gifs, pictures, exercises) from the Debugging section of part1.md.  Download LICEcap and use it to make gifs (unless you already use a program).  Use cloud9 when you show examples; don't run any code on your own computer.
