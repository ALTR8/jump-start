      - We'll call out when it's time to switch
  - Bathrooms
  - Water
  - TAs
    - INTRODUCE TAS: former students who've succeeded in the program, ask them for help

- You're not competing
    - We take everyone over the bar
    - All at different places
    - Help each other out

- Some people overstress about this program
    - The less sleep you get, the worse you'll do.
    - GET SLEEP over finishing
    - We do expect you to spend all the time you can outside of the formal hours on the material.
    - But sleep first

- Prioritize the exercises
  - We know the most value for you is the fact that you have everyone here
  - Especially TAs
  - We'll make sure to give that to you as much as possible.
  - So we want to make sure you look like THIS

- And not THIS (change slide)
  - This means we'll have occasional lectures for a brief 30 mins where we solve the most common problems we saw.  But the most value for you is in doing the exercises and getting over the walls you hit after you struggle with the problems a bit.
  - Deliberate practice.

- Curriculum
  - Do Part 1 first, then Part 2, Part 3, etc.
  - THEN problem sets
  - Show README.md on curriculum page

- If you have a question
  - We have readings for you to reference once something is unfamiliar or you hit a wall.
  - NOTE: do the exercises first
  - If you can do the exercises without doing the readings, that's great.  Just do that.
  - Readings, Google, TA, Class Slack
    - You'll see post its when you sit down.
    - Walk through example: ask TA berkeley q1
    - We have a slack channel to ask questions, you should have gotten emails
    - For today, it's OK to raise your hand too.

- 2 assessments: 1 at end of week 1, 1 at end of week 2
  - We don't expect everyone to pass these.
  - This is to give us a sense of where you are
  - If you don't pass these, you can still get into the program!

- Now we're about to email out a quick test to see how far you are
    - Old interview problem
    - OK if you don't get it, this is to gauge where you are
    - Email us the completed code once you're done at:
    - You have 15 minutes
    - Once you're done, start on the curriculum.
