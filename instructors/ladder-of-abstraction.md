# The Ladder of Abstraction

> S. I. Hayakawa once gave this illustration of the "ladder of abstraction", and in particular, the difference between going up or down:

Up the ladder:

> "What is meant by the word red?"
> "It's a color."
> "What's a color?"
> "Why, it's a quality things have."
> "What's a quality?"

vs.

Down the ladder:

> "What is meant by the word red?"
> "Well, the next time you see some cars stopped at an intersection, look at the traffic light facing them.  Also, you might go to the fire department and see how their trucks are painted."

> "Red is a color" is moving up the ladder; "color" is a supercategory of red.  All things which are red, have colors; but not all things which have colors, are red.  And similarly, if you look at a specific firetruck, that firetruck is a red thing, but there are also many other red things which are not that firetruck.

Go down the ladder of abstraction when explaining concepts to students.
