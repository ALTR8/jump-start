# Teaching Philosophy

From Asher: Some people were interested in reading about my teaching philosophy.  Here's an overview, as well as examples of how I use them in the curriculum.

(Note: this was written quickly, so I haven't applied all my teaching principles to this document to teach you...)

## The Ladder of Abstraction

[Reading](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bc3/sotw_be_specific/)

Read the first section.  You can stop at "A closely related skill is concreteness."  (Though you can keep reading if interested.)

### Examples in the course

For algorithms, pictures and animations are better than paragraph descriptions.  See bubble_sort in part3 of jumpstart.

GIFs of people using commands/writing code are better than static pictures and examples of code.

Pictures and code examples of how you'd use a method are better than describing that method in words.

Exercises are better than written curriculum.

Saying "call array dot pop" instead of "Call the instance method `pop` on the array".  Avoid jargon.  Use their language.

### Summary

"Specific examples are better than concepts."

## Systematizing

Can't find a good reading on this.

### Examples in the course

Students used to raise their hand to ask questions.  TAs would have to notice them and run over.  Questions would go missed and TAs immediately had to respond.  Our solution was to use Slack to aggregate questions and track who was responding.  NY improved this by writing the progress tracker questions app we have now.

Students ask the same types of questions on a project. For example, they forget to db:migrate on heroku the first time they push.  Or they make a pass-by-reference error in chess.  We solve this by changing the github document that they read to include an exercise on pass-by-reference.  For final projects, we create an FAQ that TAs can point students at so that students spend less time answering questions.

Students used to spend a lot of time debugging their assessments.  So I created screwedoku and your debugging lecture.

"Teach a student to fish."

### Summary

"How can we solve this problem now, for everyone, forever?"

## Active Learning and Constructionism/Constructivism

[Reading 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)
[Reading 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education))

### Examples in the course

TAs ask students questions instead of immediately explaining an answer.  We add details slowly once students have grappled with the problems.  Talking at a student doesn't let them construct the concept in their head.  If they don't construct a concept in their head, they'll forget.

We make students do exercises and build projects instead of read books.

Fewer lectures (less talking at people), more project time (more people constructing knowledge for themselves). If I lecture, I have students do problems and explain to partners during lecture.

I encourage breaking code quickly so students can get a feel for the structure instead of walking on eggshells.

### Summary

"Construct the knowledge for yourself"


## Social Learning

[Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_theory)

### Examples in the course

Students explain to partners during lecture.

Pair programming

### Summary

"Learn with people"

## Take breaks

[Reading](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211793)

### Examples in the course

After solving a tricky bug, I tell students to take a break for five minutes

15 minute break in the afternoon

Switch partners every 15 minutes

Emphasizing sleep

### Summary

"Alternate focus and breaks"


## Exercises (not required, for your learning only)

1. Come up with three ideas for how you'd systematize the course.  If you can implement one in less than two hours, make a pull request (or email Asher to run it by him).

2. Describe the ladder of abstraction in your own words.  Find one example where going down the ladder of abstraction wouldn't work well.
