# Instructor Best practices

* Make the student type everything out.  Don't take the keyboard yourself.
* But it's OK to pop open irb to demonstrate a small example if they're really not getting it.
* Ask the student questions to test if they understand the concept.
    * Don't talk at the student.
    * A good rule of thumb: don't spend more than 10 seconds explaining a concept without the student speaking/explaining back to you.
* Go down the [ladder of abstraction](./ladder-of-abstraction.md)
