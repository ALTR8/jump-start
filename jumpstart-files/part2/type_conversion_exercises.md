# Type Conversion Exercises

0. Define a method, `#two_digit_sum`, that accepts a two-digit integer as an argument. Your method should return the sum of the two digits.

  ```ruby
    two_digit_sum(34) == 7 # ==> 3 + 4 == 7
  ```

0. Define a method, `#orders_of_magnitude`, that accepts an integer as an argument. Your method should return the number of digits in the integer.

  ```ruby
    orders_of_magnitude(99) == 2
    orders_of_magnitude(1034) == 4
  ```

0. Define a method, `#accurate_division`, that accepts two **integers** as arguments. Your method should return the quotient of the two integers (rounding to 3 decimal places).

  ```ruby
    accurate_division(3, 4) == 0.750
    accurate_division(1, 3) == 0.333
    accurate_division(7, 6) == 1.167
  ```
