# Numbers Exercises

  0. Write a method, `#division_plus_remainder`, that accepts two integers, `big_int` and `small_int`, as arguments. Your method should find the number of times `small_int` completely divides into `big_int`, and then adds the remainder that's left over. For example, `divisor_plus_remainder(7, 2)` should equal `4`.

  0. Write a method `#divide_two_places`, that accepts two floats, `big_float` and `small_float`, as arguments. Your method should divide `big_float` / `small_float` and round to two decimal places.
