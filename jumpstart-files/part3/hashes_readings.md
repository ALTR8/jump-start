  * [Hash Maps] (https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/ruby-beginner-en-F3loB/1/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)

## Key Concepts
  * A.k.a., a dictionary or a map
  * Also can conceive of as an array, but with indices other than integers
  * Initialized like so: `hash = {}`
  * Hash rockets `{ 1 => "one" }`
  * Hash keys are all unique
  * `nil` values by default

  * Important methods:
    * `hash[key]` and `hash[key] = value`
    * `#keys`
    * `#values`
    * `#each do |key, value|`
