# Ruby Setup

## Make a Cloud9 account

Start by making a [Cloud9 account][c9]. Cloud9 will ask for your credit card info, but they don't charge you unless you ask to upgrade (we'll vouch for them!) If you'd prefer not to disclose your credit card info, feel free to use [CodeAnywhere][ca] instead.

Once you have an account on Cloud9, follow the following steps:

![Setup Cloud9](./setup-cloud9.gif)

0. Create a new workspace; call it 'jumpstart'
0. Choose 'custom' when asked to chose a template


## Test that it works for you

By the time you start JumpStart on Monday, you should be able to write and run a ruby file that puts "hello world" to a terminal console, either on Cloud9 or your system ruby.

Test your environment by following these steps:

![Hello World Cloud9](./hello-world-cloud9.gif)

0. Create a new file called `test.rb`; put it in the 'jumpstart' folder
0. write the line `puts "Hello World!"` in `test.rb`
0. Open a new terminal and run `ruby test.rb` - You should see "Hello World!"
