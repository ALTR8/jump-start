# Intro to JumpStart

## Course Structure

Here's what the average day will look like:

When        | What
----------  |:---------------------:
6:30pm      | Attendance
6:30 - 7:00 | Code demo & Q/A
7:00 - 7:30 | Warm-up
7:30 - 9:30 | Independent work
9:30 +      | Homework problem

### Attendance
  We will take attendance every day; your record will be considered when making admission decisions. You **must** be present for attendance on assessment days.

### Code Demo
  During the coding demo, we will demonstrate solving a challenging coding problem that was assigned as homework the night before. Here, we will focus more on problem-solving architectures and design techniques.

### Warm-up
  You will have a different warm-up partner every day. Pairs will be assigned via email at the beginning of the day. After meeting your pair, the two of you will solve two sets of problems and answer the discussion questions together.

### Independent Work
  The majority of your time in JumpStart will be spent doing independent work. The independence will allow you to go through the curriculum at your own pace, but will also require some intrinsic motivation.

  You will be grouped with other students at similar levels. Each pod will have a TA mentor. You are **strongly encouraged** to discuss problems with your fellow pod members and to ask your TA mentor for help.

## Assessments

You will have an assessment on both Thursdays during JumpStart. If you receive a passing score on either, your application will be forwarded to our admissions team for a final review. You do not need to attend week 2 if you pass assessment 1.

## If you have questions

1. Try to google it first.
2. Ask the person next to you to see if they've had the same question
3. Ask a TA for help.  They will tell you to google it first, so make sure you've done step 1.

A good rule of thumb is: if you're stuck for more than five minutes and the top three google answers don't make sense to you, call for a TA.

## How to approach JumpStart

As you do the exercises, type everything out as you go along.  Don't read text and assume you know it.  This usually means that, at some point, you're running `ruby my_file.rb` and understanding what's going on in the file.

Everyone who clears our bar gets in.  This means you should be helping your fellow JumpStarters.  You are not competing with them.  There is no limit to the number of people we take.

You're all at different levels and will work at different paces.  Don't worry if someone moves faster than you or solves problems faster than you.  What's important is that you continually build a foundation of what you know.  We expect people to be at different places by the middle of the curriculum.

If you DON'T pass the assessments, you can still get into our program!  We don't expect everyone to pass the assessments.  The worst thing you can do is overstress about the assessments--you can still interview with us later, and you've gotten a bunch of extra practice that you wouldn't have had otherwise by doing JumpStart.

As you work, try the exercises before you consult the readings.  Look at the readings once you find an unfamiliar concept or you get stuck.

Feel free to start going through the curriculum on your own.  The better prepared you are, the better.
