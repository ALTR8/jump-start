# Zen and the Art of Programming

In order to be a great software engineer, there are certain tangental skills that must be cultivated:

* Logical Reasoning
* Numerical Reasoning
* Procedural Reasoning
* Curiosity
* Debugging
* **Patience**

One of the primary goals of the course is to provide you with the a foundation and resources to develop these skills.

*The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.*

-Edsger Dijkstra

Once you start implementing programs of a sufficient complexity, you will find that it is very easy to make mistakes. Unlike computers, the human brain does not always think in perfect logic or arithmetic. The software engineers of the past quickly realized this and started developing techniques and structures to manage the complexity of their programs: variables, good style, abstraction and decomposition, objects and classes. Don't worry if some of those words seem unfamiliar. We will explore them all and more in the course.
