# Ruby Setup

## Make a Cloud9 account

In order to make the most of your time in JumpStart, you need to be using ruby the right way.

Setup ruby using [this doc][setup], steps 1-4.  We strongly recommend that you use Cloud9.

If you decide to use your computer's ruby instead, TAs may not be able to answer questions about it.

Once you have an account on Cloud9, follow the gif below:

![Setup Cloud9](./setup-cloud9.gif)


## Test that it works for you

By the time you start JumpStart on Monday, you should be able to write and run a ruby file that puts "hello world" to a terminal console, either on Cloud9 or your system ruby.

Avoid using a repl like [repl.it][repl.it] for this JumpStart course--we need to teach you some powerful tools that repl doesn't have.

Test now.  You can also follow this gif:
