# Your Coding Environment

In this section we'll talk about how ruby interacts with your computer.

## Instructions

**Do every exercise.**  Feel free to skim the readings and then use them as references during the exercises to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.

You will not learn by simply reading about code. **You must write it too.** Do the exercises :)

**Call over a TA** when you hit a "mandatory check point".
