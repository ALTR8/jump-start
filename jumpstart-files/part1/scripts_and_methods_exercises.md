# Scripts and Methods exercises

0. Create a new file, `methods_exercises.rb`. Define the following methods in this script:

0. Write a method `#print_thrice`, that accepts an integer as an argument. It should `puts` that number 3 times.

```ruby
  def print_thrice(n)
    # Your code here
  end
```

0. Write a method, `#print_thrice_thrice`, that also accepts an integer as an argument. It should call `print_thrice` with that number three times (for 9 total prints).

0. Test your methods by invoking them in your script and running your script from the terminal.
