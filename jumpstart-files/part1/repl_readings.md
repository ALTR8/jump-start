# IRB

## Introduction

The Interactive Ruby Shell, more commonly known as IRB, is one of the most important tools for a new developer. IRB allows you to quickly test small bits of code without having to create new scripts.

To get it up and running, all you need to do is type the following into a terminal prompt:

`irb`

![IRB Launch](./assets/irb-launch.png)

This launches IRB and brings you into a view like this:

![IRB View](./assets/irb-view.png)

When you are finished with IRB, type exit to quit:

![IRB Quit](./assets/irb-quit.png)
