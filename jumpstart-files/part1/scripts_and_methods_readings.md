# Scripts and Methods

## Introduction

Let's start this section with a few definitions:

* **script** --> A file that contains code. We run ruby scripts from the terminal by typing `ruby script_name.rb`
* **method** --> A function or set of commands that were bundled together. We can use scripts to define methods and execute them.

You've already used several methods, like `#capitalize`, and even `+` (integer addition) is a method in ruby! We haven't written any scripts yet. Let's change that!

## Our first script

  * Create a new file called `my_script.rb`
  * Enter the following code into that file:

  ```ruby
    puts "Hello, world!"
  ```

  * Using the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `my_script.rb`
  * Tell your computer to run the script by typing: `ruby my_script.rb`
