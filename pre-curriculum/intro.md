# Intro to JumpStart

## Course Structure

Here's the way most days will work.

* Day begins at 6:30pm.
* You will work on our lesson plans on your own computer.  These lesson plans mainly consist of exercises and problems.  The exercises start out easy, but will ramp up quickly.  Work at your own pace.
* If you finish every part of our curriculum, you will start to work through our final problem sets.
* We'll have a 30 minute lecture in the middle, in which your instructor will address the common questions they saw pop up.
* Class ends at 9:30pm.
* Class runs Monday through Thursday, but the facility is open 24/7.
* Outside of JumpStart, we still expect you to be working on these projects when you have the time.


# Assessments

On the final day of each week, we will give you an assessment. The assessment will take place at the end of the day and will last for one hour.  The assessment will be a power-testâ€”that is, we're going to give you more problems than you can probably solve in an hour, and it's up to you which ones you work on and how many you solve.

We'll give you more information about it going forward, but rest assured that we know what's on the assessment, and will be tailoring the curriculum to give you everything you need to do well.

Just keep coming in, make sure you get plenty of sleep, and you should be fully prepared by the second assessment.  We don't expect most people to pass the first assessment, but it should give you a taste of where we want you to be by the second assessment.


## If you have questions

1. Try to google it first.
2. Ask the person next to you to see if they've had the same question
3. Ask a TA for help.  They will tell you to google it first, so make sure you've done step 1.

## How to approach JumpStart

As you do the exercises, type everything out as you go along.  Don't read text and assume you know it.  This usually means that, at some point, you're running `ruby my_file.rb` and understanding what's going on in the file.

Everyone who clears our bar gets in.  This means you should be helping your fellow JumpStarters.  You are not competing with them.  There is no limit to the number of people we take.

You're all at different levels and will work at different paces.  Don't worry if someone moves faster than you or solves problems faster than you.  What's important is that you continually build a foundation of what you know.  We expect people to be at different places by the middle of the curriculum.

If you DON'T pass the assessment, you can still get into our program!  We don't expect everyone to pass the assessment.  The worst thing you can do is overstress about the assessment--you can still interview with us later, and you've gotten a bunch of extra practice that you wouldn't have had otherwise by doing JumpStart.

As you work, try the exercises before you consult the readings.  Look at the readings once you find an unfamiliar concept or you get stuck.

## Reading this before the course starts?

Feel free to start going through the curriculum on your own.  The better prepared you are, the better.
