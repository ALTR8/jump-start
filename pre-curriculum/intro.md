# Intro to JumpStart

## Course Structure

Here's the way most days will work.

* Day begins at 6:30pm.
* You will work on our lesson plans on your own computer.  These lesson plans mainly consist of exercises and problems.
* If you finish every part of our curriculum, you will start to work through our final problem sets.
* We'll have a 30 minute lecture at 7:45pm, in which your instructor will solve some of the problems that you did the day before and answer common questions they saw pop up.
* Class ends at 9:30pm.
* Class runs Monday through Thursday, but the facility is open 24/7.
* Outside of JumpStart, we still expect you to be working on these projects when you have the time.

The exercises start out easy, but will ramp up quickly.

At the end of these two weeks, we'll have a "final assessment".  This assessment will have problems just like what you would see on our interview.  If you pass the assessment, you get into the program.

## If you have questions

1. Try to google it first.
2. Ask the person next to you to see if they've had the same question
3. Write your name on the board and a TA will find you to help.  They will tell you to google it first, so make sure you've done step 1.

## How to approach JumpStart

* As you do the exercises, type everything out as you go along.  Don't read text and assume you know it.  This usually means that, at some point, you're running `ruby my_file.rb` and understanding what's going on in the file.

* Everyone who clears our bar gets in.  This means you should be helping your fellow JumpStarters.  You are not competing with them.  There is no limit to the number of people we take.

* You're all at different levels and will work at different paces.  Don't worry if someone moves faster than you or solves problems faster than you.  What's important is that you continually build a foundation of what you know.  We expect people to be at different places by the middle of the curriculum.

* If you DON'T pass the assessment, you can still get into our program!  We don't expect everyone to pass the assessment.  The worst thing you can do is overstress about the assessment--you can still interview with us later, and you've gotten a bunch of extra practice that you wouldn't have had otherwise by doing JumpStart.
