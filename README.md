# Daily Schedule

Other than a brief intro lecture on day one, each day will consist of:

- Warm-up (15 min) - working in pairs to solve two short problems and discussing your solutions with another pair in your pod
- Work time (~2 hours) - working through the curriculum, problem sets, and CodeEval with instructors available for one-on-one questions
- Lecture (30 min) - brief talk and/or demo on coding topics, common issues, solutions, etc.

Depending on which pod you are in, lecture may come before or after the warm-up and work time.

# Curriculum

Start by going through parts 1-4.  Do not do the problem sets until after you're done with part 4.

##### [Part 1](./jumpstart-files/part1/part1.md)
##### [Part 2](./jumpstart-files/part2/part2.md)
##### [Part 3](./jumpstart-files/part3/part3.md)
##### [Part 4](./jumpstart-files/part4/part4.md)

#### Problem Sets

Once you're done with parts 1-4, work through the problem sets.

Solutions live [here](./jumpstart-files/solutions).  **DO NOT look at them until you have tried the problems.**

##### [Problem set 1](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-1.rb)
##### [Problem set 2](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-2.rb)
##### [Problem set 3](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-3.rb)
##### [Problem set 4](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-4.rb)
##### [Problem set 5](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-5.rb)

**Recommended Checkpoint: complete problem sets 1-5 by day 2 of the second week of the program.**

##### [Problem set 6 - Practice Assessment](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-6.rb)
##### [Problem set 7](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-7.rb)
##### [Problem set 8 - Second Practice Assessment](./jumpstart-files/problem-sets/problem-set-8.rb)


#### CodeEval

Once you're finished with the problem sets, follow the CodeEval instructions below.  Don't worry if you don't get here, we'll all jump on CodeEval together as the course progresses.
