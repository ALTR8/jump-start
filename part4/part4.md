# Lesson Plan

### "Be" the debugger

You should be able to look at code you wrote and walk through that code from beginning to end, knowing exactly what every variable is at every point in time.  If you're watching The Godfather and you pause an hour in, you should know the names of all the characters onscreen.

This skill is important in our interview, because we don't let students run their code during the interview.
