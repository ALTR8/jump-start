JumpStarters,

I'm excited to see you all on the 28th!  Before you show up, there's a bit of additional prep you'll have to do.

1. Complete the ruby track on codecademy (you should have seen this instruction in your acceptance letter as well).

2. Complete the steps in the Pre-Curriculum section here: https://github.com/appacademy/jump-start

Feel free to email us if you have questions at jumpstart-instructors@appacademy.io
